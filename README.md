# Bank Tech Test

This is a Tech Test made using Ruby. A user can interact with the code via IRB to check the status of the bank account, depoit and withdraw money and print the statement with the date of the transaction, the amount and the balance.

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/rolandosorbelli/bank.git`

run `bundle install`

## Usage

You can interact with the project using your IRB.


## Running tests

run `rspec`

The test for the output of the statement is missing, that's why I included a feature test in the spec folder so you can test in the IRB that the statement can be printed.
